# code-submissions
This repo this for my code submissions for online events.


**The programming languages I am using are**
* Python (I am learning currently)
* Java
* C/Cpp

**Text Editor/IDEs**
* neovim (I will post my vim script too for this, and will try to make it minimal)
* maybe VSVode? idk

**Folders Struct**
* leetcode (contains [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) submissions)
* cf (contains [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) submissions)
* DSA practice maybe
* others (contains other than these)
* utils (the bash scripts I am using to get templates, compile, and debug)
* bin (to store binaries , will be under gitignore, but important for running compilation)


Some global variables I will use will update later.

I don't know how successful it will be, but I am planning to somehow record the time I required for thinking, writing, and debugging each solution, using some bash scripts.

**Todo**
- [ ] Build a naming convention for both cf and leetcode
    - [ ] first for leetcode
    - [ ] including binary files convention
- [ ] get basic compilation scripts for each lang respectively
- [ ] get basic template build script for each lang
- [ ] the template should include the URL for the problem, timestamps (later), and other attributes like, did I see the solution before coding, and what other important links are there for this solution.
- [ ] go extensionless for compiling and generating scripts
- [ ] bash script for scoring habit tracking points!
- [ ] maybe if I continue with this, a way to store test cases and test them automatically 

Todo for compilation script cpp
As I m using cpp the most rn its easier to start with that only
- [ ] include fsanitise
- [ ] storing binary files
